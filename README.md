# Number-Guessing-Game
A simple Number Guessing Game built using Python and Tkinter. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player guesses the number. It provides feedback like "Too High," "Too Low," or "Correct!" This project is beginner-friendly and a fun way to learn GUI programming with Tkinter.
